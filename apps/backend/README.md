## About

This is the backend of Evelyn's dashboard and is required in order for the user to enable / disable features and tailor Evelyn to their needs.

## Credits
This project (along with the Evelyn dashboard) are based upon [Fuma](https://github.com/SonMooSans)'s dashboard backend template. All credits go out to them for the original version of this project.
