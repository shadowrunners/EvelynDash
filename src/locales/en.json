Additionally, for integration purposes, we collect webhook related information including IDs and tokens that were exclusively created by Evelyn. We collect this information solely for the purpose of integrating and ensuring that systems such as moderation logging and confessions work properly. Webhook tokens are treated as sensitive and confidential information and thus have additional protection set in place in order to safeguard them from unauthorized access and are not shared with any 3rd parties.",

        "section2_r": " · By default, Evelyn does not send any information to third party services. However, components such as the anti-phishing component require us to send any message containing URLs to their service to detect and flag harmful links. This process is entirely anonymously and does not expose any identifying information (such as the user's ID or username). Please note that this feature is opt-in, and you have the choice to opt out at any time.",

        "section3_r": "· The collected data is securely stored in a MongoDB database to prevent external access. While extensive security measures are in place, we (Shadowrunners) cannot guarantee absolute protection against unintentional or malicious breaches of data. In the unlikely event of a breach, all users will be promptly notified through the Discord client application.",

We do not knowingly collect or retain personal information from users who fall below this age threshold. If you are under the specified age limit, we ask that you refrain from using the bot's services. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from an underage user, we will take swift measures to remove the information from our systems and suspend the user's access indefinitely.",
